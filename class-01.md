# Duckett HTML
## Introduction
* This book for leaning to build website from zero point or to develop websites, the structure for this book divided to HTML in general, CSS, the dedicated coding HTML5 type.
* There are a way to access the web such as browsers, web servers, screen readers, and other devices, to create a small website we just need HTML and CSS usually.
* To visit website we should connect to Domain Name System (DNS) server in any where website in the world.
## Structure 
* In coding we have a tags describe the coding type, for example 
<!DOCTYPE HTML> is for HTML5 coing and so on, and for tages we have open tag 
<character attribute> also closing one </ the same character>, often we use this formula for most of them but not all, some of tags haven't aclosing tag.

## Extra Markup
| **Tag** | describtion |
| ------- | ----------- |
| (<!DOCTYPE HTML>) | as we mentioned before for HTML5 coding |
|(<!-- comment -->) | for comment it will not appear in web page it's for coding just |
| <character ***id="text"***> | the bold italic sentence for giving for tag an id and call it when need that by hash tag sign (#) |
| <character ***class="text"***> | the bold italic sentence for giving for tag a class and call it when need that by dote sign (.) |
| <div> | for group of elements in a block |
| <span> | for group of element in a inline |
| <iframe> | to open another website in same website that you make |
* There are a block statment tage thats mean it will take the page in separate line like <p> tag, on the other hand we have inline statment tag it appears in the same line of other inline tages like <b> tag.
* escape charater

## Process & Design 
* make wirefram ----> apply this in code (the general form of web, colos, etc...)

# Duckett JavaScript
## Introduction
* JavaScript make web more interactive by:
1- Access content
2- Modify content
3- Program rules
4- React of event
## The ABC of Programming 
* Computers create models of the world using data. The models use objects to represent physical things. 
* Objects can have: properties that tell us about the object; methods that perform tasks using the properties of that object; events which are triggered when a user interacts with the computer. 
* Programmers can write code to say "When this event occurs, run that code." 
* Web browsers use HTML markup to create a model of the web page. Each element creates its own node (which is a kind of object). 
* To make web pages interactive, you write code that uses the browser's model of the web page.
