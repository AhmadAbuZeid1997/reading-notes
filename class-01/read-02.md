# Basic JavaScript Instructions
* Writing comment make our code easy to understand; because we can have hundred of statement in one web page.
* JavaScript deal with variables that asign to value, it is worth say a variable is a good name for this concept because the data storedin a variable can change (or vary) each time a script runs.
* Declare variable:
var variable name;
* Then asign value:
variable name= value;
* Types of variable: 
1- Number(1,3,5,....)
2- string("any thing") we can use single qutation instead of double qutation
3- Boolean (True or Fulse)
* Rules to name the variable:
1- The name must begin with a letter, dollar sign ($),or an underscore (_). It must not start with a number.
2-The name can contain letters, numbers, dollar sign ($), or an underscore (_). Note that you must not use a dash(-) or a period (.) in a variable name.
3- You cannot use keywords or reserved words.
4- All variables are case sensitive.
5- Use a name that describes the kind of information that the variable stores. 
6- If your variable name is made up of more than one word, use a capital letter for the first letter of every word after the first word.
* Variables can sign a row of data between brackets and the data separated by comma for example
variable = [1,2,4]
and we can call a value 
variable[2] it is a 2
* Oparators

* Logical operators:
* Equal to " == " to see if are the same.
* Is not equal to " != " to see if they are not the same.
* Strict not equal to " !== " to check both the data type and value are not the same.
* Strict equal to " === " to check both the data type and value are the same.
* Greater than " > " check if the number on the left is greater than the number on the right.
* less than " < " check if the number on the left is less than the number on the right.
* Greater than or equal to " >= " check if the number on the left is greater than or equal the number on the right.
* less than or equal to " <= " check if the number on the left is less than or equal to the number on the right.
* Logical and " && " tests more than one condition.
* Logical or " || " tests at least one condition.
* Logical not " !" takes a signal boolean value and inverts it.
