# Lists 
* There are three type of lists:
1- Order list the structure written:
```
&lt; ol &gt;  // opening tag for order list

   &lt; li &gt; // opening tag for each item
   
   &lt; / li &gt; // closing tag for each item 
   
&lt; ol &gt; // closing tag for order list
```
2- Unorder list It's written exactly like order list, but write ul instead of ol.

3- definition list 
```
&lt; dl &gt;  // opening tag for definition list

   &lt; dt &gt; // openning tag This is used to contain the term being defined 
   
   &lt; / dt &gt; // closing tag 
   
    &lt; dd &gt; // opening tag to contain the definition
    
    &lt; / dd &gt; // closing tag
    
&lt; ol &gt; // closing tag for order list
```
* We can make nested list by combine lists with each other.
# Boxes
* In CSS you can call some character and change the properties here some it

# Arrays 
* We can assign row of values to one variable by assign values between brackets separated by comma for example
var x=['ahmad', 'mohammad', 'Abu Zeid']
# Condition & Loop Statement
* **If statement** condition statement that take two possible reaction according to logical value
If (condition) {
    action to do if true
}else {
    action to do if fulse
}
 * **Switch** statement take specific action according to value received 
 switch (leveel){
     case 'one';
     action to do 
     case 'two';
     action to do 
     case 'three';
     action to do 
     .
     .
     .
     defult;
     action to do
 }
* **For loop** loop statement that repeat itself a certain times
For (initial value; condition; change value of counter)
{
    action to do
}
* **While** loop statement that repeat itself unkown times
while (condition){
    action to do 
    cahnge value of counter
}
* **DO While** The key difference between a while loop and do while loop is that the statements in the code block come before the condition.
