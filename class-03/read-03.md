# Lists 
* There are three type of lists:
1- Order list the structure written:
```< ol >  // opening tag for order list

   < li > // opening tag for each item
   
   < / li > // closing tag for each item 
   
< ol > // closing tag for order list```
```

2- Unorder list It's written exactly like order list, but write ul instead of ol.

3- definition list 
```< dl >  // opening tag for definition list

   < dt > // openning tag This is used to contain the term being defined 
   
   < / dt > // closing tag 
   
    < dd > // opening tag to contain the definition
    
    < / dd > // closing tag
    
< ol > // closing tag for order list```
```
* We can make nested list by combine lists with each other.
# Boxes
* In CSS you can call some character and change the properties here some it

# Arrays 
* We can assign row of values to one variable by assign values between brackets separated by comma for example
var x=['ahmad', 'mohammad', 'Abu Zeid']
# Condition & Loop Statement
* **If statement** condition statement that take two possible reaction according to logical value
If (condition) {
    action to do if true
}else {
    action to do if fulse
}
 * **Switch** statement take specific action according to value received 
 switch (leveel){
     case 'one';
     action to do 
     case 'two';
     action to do 
     case 'three';
     action to do 
     .
     .
     .
     defult;
     action to do
 }
* **For loop** loop statement that repeat itself a certain times
For (initial value; condition; change value of counter)
{
    action to do
}
* **While** loop statement that repeat itself unkown times
while (condition){
    action to do 
    cahnge value of counter
}
* **DO While** The key difference between a while loop and do while loop is that the statements in the code block come before the condition.
